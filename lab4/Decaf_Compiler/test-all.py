# A test harness that automatically runs your compiler on all of the tests
# in the 'samples' directory.  This should help you diagnose errors in your
# compiler and will help you gauge your progress as you're going.  It also
# will help catch any regressions you accidentally introduce later on in
# the project.
#
# That said, this test script is not designed to catch all errors and you
# will need to do your own testing.  Be sure to look over these tests
# carefully and to think over what cases are covered and, more importantly,
# what cases are not.
